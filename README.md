# androidUnitTest
Practicing with unit testing for Android: unit testing with Robolectric and UI testing with Espresso.

Testing every part of my program is one of the most important practice I have learned. 
In the branch testRobolectric, I test my code with Robolectric framework. 
In the branch testEspresso, I test the UI using Espresso framework. Remember to disable animation in your emulator 
for UI testing and add the correct dependency in gradle file. Visit android espresso main websiter.
